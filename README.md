- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used for handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering HTML templates.
- **NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy):** Used for text processing to extract meaningful information from movie descriptions and user reviews.
- **Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow):** Used for building and training recommendation models.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Used for building the user interface and handling client-side interactions.
